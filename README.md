#Steps Performed
##1. Data Preprocessing

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Checked for missing and duplicate records

Converted date column to datetime format

Filled missing values appropriately

Removed outliers and standardized categorical values

##2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed total layoffs by year and month

Compared layoffs across industries and countries

Identified top 10 companies with the highest layoffs

Explored percentage_laid_off vs funds_raised_millions

Used bar plots, line plots, and heatmaps for visualization

##3. Visualization

Layoffs over time: Identified major spikes in specific years

Industry-wise comparison: Highlighted sectors most affected

Geographical insights: Countries/regions with the largest layoffs

Company funding vs layoffs: Explored financial correlation

#Conclusion

This project provides insights into how global economic conditions, funding, and industry trends have impacted the tech job market.
It reveals that layoffs tend to increase during periods of financial uncertainty and that startup-stage companies are more vulnerable to funding shortages.
